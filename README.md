# Augmenting-choices-by-extracting-subtopics-from-Yelp


The intent of the paper is to identify subcategories of businesses and services by studying user reviews on Yelp. Further, the study was extended to identify categories that are non-intuitive. These subcategories can help businesses boost their revenue, while users can quickly locate businesses and services based on popular subcategories.

Identifying non-intuitive sub categories will enhance the profile of a particular neighborhood as these are some of the most unique businesses that are listed on Yelp. I used the Yelp academic open dataset that has 4.1 Million user reviews. 

To find the latent subcategories by studying the reviews, I employed the Natural Language Took Kit, to compute n-gram and their frequency of occurrences. For identifying the non-intuitive categories 1.1 Million business attributes that are tagged by the users were combined with the business categories for three target cities. 

Overall a lot of interesting insights were discovered, this could definitely help the users and businesses alike.
